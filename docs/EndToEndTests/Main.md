### Overview

These tests deal with all issues related to the main screens of the app.

## Side Drawer Menu

- This tests the look and functioning of the side drawer menu with and without a project.

### Test Objectives

- Tests that all of the hamburger menu can be opened and closed from the map screen
- Ensures that the list items that should be present are present
- Checks that if the user is not on a project the header suggests creating or joining a project
- Once on a project, checks that the project name is visible in the header of the drawer

### Special Considerations

- These tests need to run before and after the project naming tests.
